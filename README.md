# free_budget_webapp

The goal of this project is to have a simple to use personal finance web application for a household.

My hope is that it will be similar to something like GNUCash, only usable by multiple members (example: roommates, a family).

To use this, you do have to setup your own Apache web server, and ideally bind the host machine to a static IP address so anyone connected to their
home wi-fi can use it. There are many good guides on setting up an Apache web server, just do a quick internet search.

For my own situation, I've installed an Apache web server on a Raspberry Pi 3, and placed the respository into the html folder. 

More documentation on how to set this up once it has enough features to become useful...
